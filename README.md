# What is Conspiracy?
Conspiracy is a social deception and deduction game for two or more players.

There are two possible states of the game:
1. **No Conspiracy**: All players are 'innocent'; or
2. **Conspiracy**: *Exactly one* player is innocent and the remaining players are all in a conspiracy against the innocent.
