# Conspiracy
**Overview:** A social game of deception, deduction and paranoia.
**Players:** 2 or more (ideal is somewhere in the 4-12 range).
**Time needed:** < 5 minutes (you can set your own time limit).

As a game, Conspiracy can be played entirely without modern technology. Get a group of friends together, get some playing cards (or good ol' fashioned pen and paper), and follow the [original write-up of the game](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Conspiracy).

This Conspiracy web app ([https://play-conspiracy.web.app](https://play-conspiracy.web.app)) has been built to make it *even easier to play with a group of friends*:
- **Everybody can play at once** - no need for a neutral moderator;
- **Get to the action more quickly** - less setup faff in allocating roles;
- **Simpler to follow** - win conditions automatically applied to players.

## Summary
There are two possible states of the game:
1. **No Conspiracy**: All players are 'innocent'; or
2. **Conspiracy**: *Exactly one* player is innocent and the remaining players are all in a conspiracy against the innocent.

### 1. You're innocent
Great! You're innocent. Nothing to feel guilty about.

However, there is plenty to be worried about.

There could be a conspiracy against you.
But it all could be a figment of your imagination.

It could be the case that everybody else is feeling *just as paranoid* as you, because you're all innocent.
Or are they just playing the part of conspirators well?

You have to work it out.

But be careful - you've only got one chance to guess...

**You win if and only if you correctly identify whether or not there is a conspiracy.**

### 2. You're a conspirator
Oh dear. I'm not sure your parents would approve of this line of work.

It is what it is, however. As Grandma always said - "In for a penny, in for a pound."

You've been given the identity of the *sole innocent* in the game. All other players, including yourself, are in a *collective conspiracy* against that player.

But don't let on. If the innocent realises everybody else is acting strangely, the game will be up.

Hopefully your teammates don't let on, either - it only takes one to give it away...

**You win if and only if the sole innocent does not identify the existence of the conspiracy.**

## How to play
### Setup
1. Gather at least one other person to play with.<sup>a, b</sup>
2. Put yourselves in a suitable room.<sup>c, d</sup>
3. Every player must navigate to [https://play-conspiracy.web.app](https://play-conspiracy.web.app).<sup>e</sup>
4. Every player needs to sign up (and can do so anonymously if they choose so).
5. One player needs to be the 'host' and create a game.<sup>f</sup>
6. All players should join the created game from the lobby.
7. Once all players have marked themselves as ready to start, the host can start the game.
8. Each player will be shown a card to them which tells them if they are *Innocent* or a *Conspirator*.<sup>g</sup>

<sup>a</sup> The ideal number of total players is probably in the 4-12 range.
<sup>b</sup> This game works well both with people you know and also as an ice-breaker game!
<sup>c</sup> A good layout is one which lets you sit in a circle-like shape such that that every player can see every other player.
<sup>d</sup> Bonus points for atmospheric lighting.
<sup>e</sup> Mobile is probably most convenient, but, hey, people are allowed to lug in a desktop and monitor(s) if they feel strongly about this.
<sup>f</sup> Hosting is *not* the same as being the classic 'neutral moderator' - the host will still be an active participant just as every other player.
<sup>g</sup> For *n* players, there will be either: (i) *n* Innocents; or (ii) *1* Innocent and *n-1* Conspirators.

After setup, the main Discussion phase kicks in - this is the meat of the game, where you will spend most of your time.

### When the game has started

## FAQs
### Isn't part of the fun playing with your friends in person?
Absolutely, yes - *this web app is primarily designed to be used for in-person games*.

It aims to replace the playing cards, neutral moderator and pen/paper that you might have been using to play Conspiracy - but it is not meant to replace the discussions, accusations and paranoia of the main game.
