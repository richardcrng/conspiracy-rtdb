# Conspiracy
A social game of deception, deduction and paranoia for two or more players.

As a game, Conspiracy can be played entirely without modern technology. Get a group of friends together, get some playing cards (or good ol' fashioned pen and paper), and follow the [original write-up of the game](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Conspiracy).

This Conspiracy web app ([https://play-conspiracy.web.app](https://play-conspiracy.web.app)) has been built to make it even easier to play with friends:
- Everybody can play at once - no need for a neutral moderator;
- Get to the action more quickly - less setup faff in allocating roles;
- Simpler to follow - win conditions automatically applied to players.

## Summary
There are two possible states of the game:
1. **No Conspiracy**: All players are 'innocent'; or
2. **Conspiracy**: *Exactly one* player is innocent and the remaining players are all in a conspiracy against the innocent.

### 1. You're innocent
Great! You're innocent. Nothing to feel guilty about.

However, there is plenty to be worried about.

There could be a conspiracy against you.
But it all could be a figment of your imagination.

It could be the case that everybody else is feeling *just as paranoid* as you, because you're all innocent.
Or are they just playing the part of conspirators well?

You have to work it out.

But be careful - you've only got one chance to guess...

### 2. You're a conspirator
Oh dear. I'm not sure your parents would approve of this line of work.

It is what it is, however. As Grandma always said - "In for a penny, in for a pound."

You've been given the identity of the *sole innocent* in the game. All other players, including yourself, are in a *collective conspiracy* against that player.

But don't let on. If the innocent realises everybody else is acting strangely, the game will be up.

Hopefully your teammates don't let on, either - it only takes one to give it away...
